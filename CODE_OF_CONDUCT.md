# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders of the Violt community pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, visible or invisible, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to fostering a welcoming, respectful, and inclusive environment for all contributors and users.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Showing empathy toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information (e.g. physical or electronic addresses) without explicit permission
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject contributions, issues, comments, and other interactions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope
